# VueIPFS

This package is intended to be used as a VueJS / IPFS boilerplate. You can directly upload the folder to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) without adding any other step.
Work as usual inside your VueJS website, then use the command `yarn deploy` to automatically deploy to IPFS.

First of all you need a `.env` file inside the folder `ipfs`, so you can copy the `.env.example` file adding your:
- `PINATA_KEY`: the JWT key generated by Pinata
- `PINATA_ENDPOINT`: the endpoint of your Pinata account

Then you should be able to run the command and see something like this:
